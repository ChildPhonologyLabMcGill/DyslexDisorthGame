To develop this app,

1. run the build minified script (as a consequence of minifiying, it will put the libs, fonts etc into this directory from the parent directories, then you will be able to deubg using the unminified source)

 $ cd client
 $ ./scripts/build_tcpp_minified.sh 
 
2. load this directory as an unpacked extension.
